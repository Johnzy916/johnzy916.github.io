                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm Jhonathan, an aspiring web developer. I absolutely love to learn and solve problems. I went to school to be a graphic designer, but eventually realized that web development was my true passion. Unfortunately, I ran out of money, so I began the journey of becoming a self-taught developer. Today, I do tech/customer support while learning as much as I can to land my first official development job. Over the last few years, I've taken the initiative to learn HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, and more in my spare time. During that time, I've even developed small solutions for the jobs I've held. For example, I worked for a company that contracted with Stripe, where I developed a script to extract application data from their emails and create a spreadsheet for processing. Before that, they had to dedicate an agent to go through each email and transfer the data over to a spreadsheet. I also created a tool for the City of Sacramento that helps phone agents be more efficient. For example, they can type keywords to expand statements and templates to insert case notes, use a calendar to determine when service will be provided, and quickly access the most common service rates. The biggest time saver is the ability to copy table data from their internal system and paste it into the tool, which will format and generate a PDF or XLS spreadsheet. This process saved an agent approximately 15 minutes each time it was used. Now, I'm just looking for a company to take a chance on me, and hopefully become a mentor, because I'm certainly willing to learn.</p>
